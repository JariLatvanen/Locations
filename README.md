# LocApp
One more location app

This is assignment work for Frontend mestari class which I am attending.

The user can enter locations (latitude and longitude) by giving input in a form
or by double ckicking the map. The location data is saved into a database using
Angular Http client. 

A street view of the location is also available.

The source code and documentation is located at: https://github.com/JariLatvanen/Locations

The app was created with Angular 2+.

It uses Angular Google Maps (AGM)

A demo with in memory DB is available here:
